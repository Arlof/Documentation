Contributing
============

Remo.TV is an open source project. That means that the code is available for free,
and that anybody can contribute to it. We're always happy to have new contributors
even if it's as simple as fixing a spelling error. 

Filing a bug report
-------------------
With a GitHub account, you can `submit a bug report <https://github.com/remotv/controller/issues/new?template=bug_report.md>`_
if you've found something that doesn't behave as it should, or even just a typo! 
We have a template that you can/should follow.

Filing a Feature Suggestion
---------------------------
Think we're missing something, let's talk about it! Official feature suggestions
can also be sent on GitHub `here <https://github.com/remotv/controller/issues/new?template=feature_request.md>`_.

Changing the code yourself
--------------------------
We welcome anybody who wants to contribute their own code to the controller. 
For safety purposes, we don't allow people to push their code directly to the 
repository. Instead, you can follow these instructions:

#. `Fork <https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_
   the repository. That copies our controller into a repository that you can write 
   to. You can `clone <https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_ 
   it to your own computer or edit it straight on GitHub.
#. Make your changes. Don't forget to `commit <https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project>`_ 
   and `push <https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository>`_ 
   to your forked repo.
#. Make a `pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_. 
   We'll discuss it and if we decide that it's something that would be beneficial,
   we'll merge it and your code will be part of everyone's robots!

We also discuss our code often on `Discord <https://discord.gg/q3Uvtn5>`_, so come check it out!
